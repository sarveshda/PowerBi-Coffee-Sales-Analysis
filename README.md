**Coffee Sales Analysis Dashboard – Project Report**

## Introduction

The **Coffee Sales Analysis Dashboard** was developed using Power BI with the goal of providing a comprehensive overview of coffee sales across multiple variables, including sales trends over time, product categories, and store locations. This dashboard is designed to assist business stakeholders in making data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategies and operational performance.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the sales data of coffee products, focusing on key metrics such as total sales, quantity sold, and performance across different days of the week, store locations, and product types. By using interactive visuals and drill-through features, the dashboard enables users to explore data from multiple angles and derive actionable insights.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Integration**: The data used for this project was sourced from sales transaction records. The dataset includes key information such as transaction dates, product categories, and store locations.

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: The raw data was cleaned to ensure accuracy, consistency, and completeness. Missing or inconsistent entries were addressed to provide a reliable dataset for analysis.

3. **Data Visualization**: Using Power BI, various visualizations were created, such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and tables, to represent sales data in an easily digestible format.

4. **Interactive Filtering**: Power BI's filter features were employed to allow users to select specific data ranges, such as sales by week, store location, or product category. This feature allows for customized views of the data to explore trends in more detail.

## Key Features

* **Total Sales Overview**: Displays total sales (718K) and total quantity sold (214K), with a detailed breakdown of sales trends over time.

* **Sales by Weekday vs Weekend**: A pie chart compares sales on weekdays versus weekends, providing insight into which days are more profitable.

* **Sales by Store Location**: A bar chart showing the sales figures for different locations such as Hell’s Kitchen, Astoria, and Lower Manhattan. This helps identify top-performing and underperforming stores.

* **Sales by Product Category**: A breakdown of sales by product category, including Coffee, Tea, Bakery, and Drinks. This visual helps in understanding which product categories generate the most revenue.

* **Time-based Analysis**: A graph that shows sales trends by day of the week and time of day. This allows for a more granular view of sales fluctuations across different times.

## Findings

* **Weekday vs Weekend Sales**: Weekdays consistently outperform weekends in terms of total sales, with mid-week days (Tuesday through Thursday) seeing the highest sales.

* **Store Location Performance**: Hell’s Kitchen and Astoria are the top-performing locations, while Lower Manhattan shows lower sales figures. This suggests potential for further exploration in those underperforming areas.

* **Popular Product Categories**: Coffee remains the dominant product, especially brewed coffee, followed by bakery items and tea. This suggests that the coffee category should be prioritized in marketing and inventory planning.

* **Time-based Sales Insights**: There is a noticeable spike in sales around mid-morning (8 AM to 10 AM) and late afternoon (3 PM to 5 PM), which can inform strategies for promotions or staffing during those hours.

## Conclusion

The **Coffee Sales Analysis Dashboard** provides valuable insights into the sales performance of coffee products, helping to identify trends, opportunities, and areas for improvement. The visualizations and interactive filters make it easy for business decision-makers to drill down into the data and make informed decisions.

## Future Recommendations

1. **Sales Forecasting**: Implement predictive analytics to forecast future sales based on current trends, helping to prepare for future demand spikes or declines.

2. **Optimizing Product Offerings**: Focus on increasing the sales of underperforming product categories, such as tea and bakery, especially in high-performing stores.

3. **Location-based Strategy**: Investigate the reasons behind lower sales in stores like Lower Manhattan. Consider targeted marketing efforts or adjustments to product offerings in these locations.

4. **Real-time Analytics**: Integrating real-time sales data into the dashboard would allow for more dynamic decision-making and the ability to react to trends as they occur.
